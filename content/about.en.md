Professional software developer, computer engineer, teacher, entrepreneur, and [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5001273) (Most Valuable Professional) in Windows Development. I don't work for Microsoft, I don't depend directly or indirectly on them, but they have graciously recognized my contributions to the community with the MVP award since 2015.


I also hold many international certifications including Microsoft Certified Professional Developer (MCPD), Microsoft Certified IT Professional (MCITP), Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist (MCTS), and Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS).


This site is the result of my contributions to the community, as I am passionate about helping all colleagues (especially Spanish-speaking) from here so that the information is useful to everyone. You will see a lot of videos on this site (training videos) especially at the business and software development level. Also, of all the articles that I write week after week. you'll usually find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/christianamado) and at some technology-related conferences offered by Microsoft.

In this article we will see how to create a basic Web API with the new **IDX Project** from **Google**, completely from the browser without the need to install anything at all in it.

The **IDX Project**, according to **Google** is:  
> PProject IDX is an AI-assisted workspace for full-stack, multiplatform app development in the cloud.
> With support for a broad range of frameworks, languages, and services, alongside integrations with your favorite Google products, IDX streamlines your development workflow so you can build and ship apps across platforms with speed, ease, and quality.

In this article we will see how to create a backend app with **.NET**, very simple as a demonstration. To do this, we will follow the following steps:

1. We enter the IDE (web) [here](https://idx.google.com/?pli=1). You need to log in with a **Google** account.  

2. We are looking for more templates (the idea is to find .NET):

3. In the **Backend** section, we look for **.NET** and select it:

4. We put a descriptive name, select the ideal environment and create the project:

5. It will show us the project creation indicator:

6. It opens the IDX (until now I saw that it is a Visual Studio Code in the cloud, just like GitHub Codespace) and we look at the example code:

7. We proceed to execute the application in question:

8. It offers us options to open the website:

9. In a new tab, it shows us the web App.

Something I noticed is that the template appears in **Backend**, but we can easily create a Full Stack application with .NET as a base to meet our needs.

At the time of writing this article I notice that **Project IDX** = **GitHub Codespace**. The base is Visual Studio Code.

I hope it is useful!
